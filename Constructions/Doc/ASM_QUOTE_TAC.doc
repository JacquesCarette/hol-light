\DOC QUOTE

\TYPE {QUOTE : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns theorem asserting that the _Q_ constant prefixed before a term is equivelant to that term in it's quoted forum, uses assumptions in goalstack in conversion.

\KEYWORDS
quotation, equality.

\DESCRIBE
{QUOTE} maps any term {`_Q_ t`} to the corresponding theorem {|- _Q_ t = Q_ t _Q}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the given term is not an application of the _Q_ operator.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # QUOTE `_Q_ 2`;;
  val it : thm = |- _Q_ 2 = Q_ (2) _Q
  
  # QUOTE `_Q_ (x + 3)`;;
  val it : thm = |- _Q_ (x + 3) = Q_ (x + 3) _Q
}

\COMMENTS
This is exactly the same as QUOTE_TAC, except it also uses theorems in the assumption list in it's computation.
