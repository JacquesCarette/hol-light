\DOC dest_quote

\TYPE {dest_quote : term : epsilon -> term * (hol_type) list}

\SYNOPSIS
Takes the quotation operator off of a quoted term

\DESCRIBE
{dest_quote} is a term destructor for quotations:
{
   dest_quote `Q_ e _Q`
}
\noindent returns {e,[]}.

\FAILURE
Fails with {dest_quote: not a quotation or type mismatch} if there is a type mismatch between the quoted term and what the quotation believes this term's type to be. This should not be a concern with well formed quotations. Also fails if the given term is not a quotation.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # dest_quote `Q_ (x + 3) _Q`;;
  val it : term * hol_type list = (`x + 3`, [])
}
