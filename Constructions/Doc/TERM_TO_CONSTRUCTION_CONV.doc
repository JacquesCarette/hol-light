\DOC TERM_TO_CONSTRUCTION_CONV

\TYPE {TERM_TO_CONSTRUCTION_CONV : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies {TERM_TO_CONSTRUCTION} to the first applicable term it finds.

\KEYWORDS
quotation, equality, construction.

\DESCRIBE
{TERM_TO_CONSTRUCTION_CONV} descends down a term and maps the first instance of {`Q_ t _Q`} to the corresponding theorem {|- Q_ t _Q = EpsilonConstruction(t)} where {EpsilonConstruction} are elements of the {Epsilon} type that represent the syntax of {t}.

\FAILURE
Fails with {TERM_TO_CONSTRUCTION_CONV} if there are no quoted subexpressions inside the given term.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # TERM_TO_CONSTRUCTION_CONV `Q_ F _Q = Q_ T _Q`;;
  val it : thm = |- Q_ (F) _Q = QuoConst "F" (TyBase "bool")
}

\COMMENTS
This can be used to apply the {TERM_TO_CONSTRUCTION} axiom on a given term without manually rewriting parts of the term. {TERM_TO_CONSTRUCTION} should still be used if control over which term is selected is desirable.
