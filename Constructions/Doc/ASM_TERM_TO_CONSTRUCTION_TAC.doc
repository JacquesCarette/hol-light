\DOC TERM_TO_CONSTRUCTION_TAC

\TYPE {TERM_TO_CONSTRUCTION_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites the goal with the first possible application of TERM_TO_CONSTRUCTION, makes use of assumptions in goalstack.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, quotation, equality, construction.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a goal {A ?- t}, where {Q_ t' _Q} is a subexpression of {t},
{TERM_TO_CONSTRUCTION_TAC} rewrites this subexpression using the theorem obtained from {TERM_TO_CONSTRUCTION t'}.


\FAILURE
Will fail if a quoted term does not appear in {t}.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # g(` Q_ T _Q = QuoConst "T" (TyBase "bool")`);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `Q_ (T) _Q = QuoConst "T" (TyBase "bool")`

  # e(TERM_TO_CONSTRUCTION_TAC);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `QuoConst "T" (TyBase "bool") = QuoConst "T" (TyBase "bool")`

}
