\DOC UNQUOTE

\TYPE {UNQUOTE : term -> term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns theorem asserting that a holed quotation "cancels". The first argument is the entire term and the second argument is the subterm to attempt to unquote.

\KEYWORDS
quotation, equality, quasiquotation.

\DESCRIBE
{UNQUOTE} maps any term {`Q_ H_ Q_ t _Q _H _Q`} to the corresponding theorem {|- Q_ H_ Q_ t _Q _H _Q = Q_ t _Q}.

\FAILURE
Fails if attempting to unquote an incomplete term, or if the second argument does not exist in the term.

\EXAMPLE
{
#  UNQUOTE `Q_ H_ Q_ 3 _Q _H _Q` `Q_ 3 _Q`;;
Warning: inventing type variables
val it : thm = |- Q_ (H_ (Q_ (3) _Q) _H) _Q = Q_ (3) _Q
}

\COMMENTS
This can be used to eliminate holes once the epsilon term inside them has been evaluated.
