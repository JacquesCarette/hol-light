\DOC QUOTE_TAC

\TYPE {QUOTE_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites the goal with the first possible application of QUOTE.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, quotation, equality.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a goal {A ?- t}, where {_Q_ t'} is a subexpression of {t},
{QUOTE_TAC} rewrites this subexpression using the theorem obtained from {QUOTE t'}.


\FAILURE
Will fail if an application of `_Q_` does not appear in {t}.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # g(`_Q_ (x + 3) = Q_ x + 3 _Q`);;
	Warning: Free variables in goal: x
	val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

	`_Q_ (x + 3) = Q_ (x + 3) _Q`

	# e(QUOTE_TAC);;
	val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

	`Q_ (x + 3) _Q = Q_ (x + 3) _Q`

}
