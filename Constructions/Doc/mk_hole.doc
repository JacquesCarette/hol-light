\DOC mk_hole

\TYPE {term : epsilon -> term : epsilon}

\SYNOPSIS
Takes any term of type epsilon and uses it to create a Hole term

\DESCRIBE
The call {mk_hole (e)} contructs the expression {Hole(e,type_of e)}. 

\FAILURE
Fails if the given term is not of type epsilon

\COMMENTS
{mk_hole (e)} achieves the exact same result as if one directly entered {H_ e _H} as a term.
