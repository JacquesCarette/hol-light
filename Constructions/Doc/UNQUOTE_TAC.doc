\DOC UNQUOTE_TAC

\TYPE {UNQUOTE_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies UNQUOTE to the first possible instance it can be applied to.

\KEYWORDS
quotation, equality, quasiquotation.

\DESCRIBE
{UNQUOTE_TAC} decends through the term on the goalstack and attempts to apply UNQUOTE to all subterms until it succeeds.

\FAILURE
Fails if there is no possible application of UNQUOTE to be found within the term

\EXAMPLE
{
# g(`Q_ H_ Q_ 3 _Q _H + 1 _Q = Q_ 3 + 1 _Q`);;
val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

`Q_ (H_ (Q_ (3) _Q) _H + 1) _Q = Q_ (3 + 1) _Q`

# e(UNQUOTE_TAC);;
val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

`Q_ (3 + 1) _Q = Q_ (3 + 1) _Q`
}

\COMMENTS
This can be used to eliminate holes once the epsilon term inside them has been evaluated.
