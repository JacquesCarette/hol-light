\TYPE {HOLE_THM_CONV : term -> thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies the first {thm} to the first applicable term it finds

\KEYWORDS
quotation, equality, quasiquotation.

\DESCRIBE
{HOLE_THM_CONV} descends down a term and maps the first applicable use of the given theorem to a theorem equating both sides.

\FAILURE
Fails with {HOLE_THM_CONV} if there is no applicable term to use the given theorem on.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # define `test = Q_ 3 _Q`;;
  val it : thm = |- test = Q_ (3) _Q

  # HOLE_THM_CONV `Q_ H_ test _H _Q` it;;
  Warning: inventing type variables
  val it : thm = |- Q_ (H_ (test) _H) _Q = Q_ (H_ (Q_ (3) _Q) _H) _Q

}

\COMMENTS
