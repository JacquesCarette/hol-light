\DOC QUOTE_CONV

\TYPE {QUOTE_CONV : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies {QUOTE} to the first applicable term it finds.

\KEYWORDS
quotation, equality.

\DESCRIBE
{QUOTE_CONV} descends down a term and maps the first instance of {`_Q_ t`} to the corresponding theorem {|- _Q_ t = Q_ t _Q}.

\FAILURE
Fails with {QUOTE_CONV} if there is no application of the {_Q_} operator in the given term

\EXAMPLE
{
  # QUOTE_CONV `_Q_ 2`;;
  val it : thm = |- _Q_ 2 = Q_ (2) _Q
  
  # QUOTE_CONV `_Q_ (x + 3) = _Q_ (x + 2)`;;
  val it : thm = |- _Q_ (x + 3) = Q_ (x + 3) _Q

  # QUOTE_CONV `1 + 2 = 3`;;
  Exception: Failure "QUOTE_CONV".
}

\COMMENTS
This can be used to apply the {QUOTE} axiom on a given term without manually rewriting parts of the term. {QUOTE} should still be used if control over which term is selected is desirable.
